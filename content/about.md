Hello, I'm Shelby Stewart, a physical therapist and Crossfit Coach originally from Palm Harbor, FL. I am now a Jacksonville, FL resident and have been a local for the past two years. I am proud to have earned my Bachelor of Science in Applied Physiology and Kinesiology with a focus in Exercise Physiology from the University of Florida. I continued on as a Florida Gator, completing my Doctorate in Physical Therapy in 2022. Crossfit has been a passion of mine for the previous eight years. Starting as an athlete, I transitioned to coaching in 2018. I currently hold my CF-L1 certificate with aspirations to become an L4 Certified Crossfit Coach.

In my career as a physical therapist, I've gained valuable experience in orthopedics and school-based pediatrics. Recently, I returned to the orthopedic/sports realm and am now the owner and clinician of Rehab Reps Physical Therapy LLC. As an active part of both the fitness and local Jacksonville community, I have continuously been inspired and uplifted. Rehab Reps was founded to give back to these communities by serving and enriching them through education, movement, and unwavering support.

My lifelong mission is to empower others through exercise and rehabilitation. I believe everyone deserves the right to control their own health and wellness. Through Rehab Reps, I provide others the tools to build physical resilience and promote longevity. Whether you're passionate about Crossfit, running, tennis, or simply enjoying an active lifestyle with your family - I am here to support you in continuing these pursuits freely. I firmly believe everyone has an accessible avenue towards a long, healthy, and fulfilling life. I am committed to be part of that journey with you.
